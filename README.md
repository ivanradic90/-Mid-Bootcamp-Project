 Build a classification model able to predict if future customers are likely to accept a credit card offer based on their characteristics.



Business Background
Position: Risk Analyst
Business: Bank
Business Services: Banking, Loans, Credit Cards
Business Objective: Understanding the demographics/characteristics of customers that accept/do not accept credit cards + adjacent findings
Data Gathering Process: The bank designed a focused marketing study, with 18,000 current bank customers. This focused approach allows the bank to know who does and does not respond to the credit card offer, and to use existing demographic data already available on each customer.
